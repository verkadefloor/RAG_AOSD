The lower section is divided into five sections separated by posts with carved half-columns. The three middle parts each contain two doors with a drawer above them.

Each coat of arms is different and is inlaid with palmwood. The panels on the beveled corners contain carved flower branches. The drawers are inlaid with ivory and palmwood and contain, like the doors, copper fittings consisting of keyplates and handles in the form of masks and predators. In the receding middle section are four display cases separated by posts with carved half-columns and figures. Below the display cases is a wide openwork rail with inlaid medallions. A forward-curved wall forms the transition from the display cases to the top. The top contains three openwork rails, two above each other and one receding above them. The two rails above each other are divided by nine posts, seven of which are crowned with carved figures. These alternately end at the bottom in lion heads or two intertwined figures. The other two posts, located on either side of the middle post, are crowned with a carved coat of arms and end at the bottom in a bull's head.",
